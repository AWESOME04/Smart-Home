# Smart-House
The project involves integrating sensors, actuators, and controllers to detect data from the environment and trigger actions on different devices

Building a smart home model with Arduino involves integrating different sensors, actuators, and microcontrollers to automate various aspects of a home. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to build a smart home model with Arduino:

Materials needed:

    Arduino Uno or Arduino Nano microcontroller board
    Breadboard and jumper wires
    Various sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity, light, motion, etc.)
    Various actuators (e.g., LED lights, motors, relays, etc.)
    Power source (e.g., batteries or AC adapter)
    WiFi module (optional)

Step 1: Setting up the Arduino
Connect the Arduino board to the computer using a USB cable and install the Arduino IDE. In the Arduino IDE, select the appropriate board and port from the "Tools" menu.

Step 2: Adding sensors
Connect the sensors to the Arduino board using jumper wires and a breadboard. Each sensor requires a specific connection protocol. Check the manufacturer's documentation for details.

Step 3: Adding actuators
Connect the actuators to the Arduino board using jumper wires and a breadboard. Each actuator requires a specific connection protocol. Check the manufacturer's documentation for details.

Step 4: Writing the code
Write the code to control the sensors and actuators. Use the Arduino IDE to write the code in the C++ programming language. The code should read data from the sensors and trigger actions on the actuators. For example, the code might turn on an LED light when the motion sensor detects movement.

Step 5: Testing the code
Upload the code to the Arduino board and test the smart home model. Verify that the sensors are detecting the correct data and the actuators are responding correctly.

Step 6: Adding WiFi connectivity (optional)
Add WiFi connectivity to the smart home model using a WiFi module. This allows the smart home model to communicate with other devices over the internet. Use the Arduino IDE to write the code for the WiFi module.

Step 7: Finalizing the smart home model
Finalize the smart home model by assembling the components and connecting them to a power source. Use a case or enclosure to protect the components from dust and moisture. Make sure that the smart home model is safe to use and follows all relevant safety guidelines.

Overall, building a smart home model with Arduino requires knowledge of electronics and programming. However, it can be a fun and rewarding project for hobbyists and makers.
